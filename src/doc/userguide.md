Introduction
------------

This operator allows you to use any [Orion Context Broker][orion] server as
source of data. This is accomplished by creating a subscription to obtain real
time notifications about changes on the entities of interest.

**NOTE:**
This WireCloud operator is based on [ngsi-source-operator](https://github.com/wirecloud-fiware/ngsi-source-operator)
created by CoNWeT Lab., Universidad Politecnica de Madrid and Future Internet Consulting and Development Solutions S.L..

Input Endpoints:

* This widget has no input endpoint

Output Endpoints:

-   **Entities:** This endpoint is used for sending initial entities as well as
    any updates received as part of the created subscription. This endpoint
    provides such entities updates using chunks of entities using the
    `keyValues` format. E.g:

        :::json
        [
            {
                "id": "van4",
                "type": "Vehicle",
                "location": {
                    "type": "Point",
                    "coordinates": [-3.7967205, 43.47173]
                }
            },
            {

            }
        ]

-   **Normalized Entities**: This endpoint is used for sending initial entities
    as well as any updates received as part of the created subscription. This
    endpoint provides such entities updates using chunks of entities using the
    `normalized` format. E.g:
